# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm

## General
	Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
	All your files should end with a new line
	A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
	Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
	You are not allowed to use global variables
	No more than 5 functions per file
	Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.
	In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
	The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
	Don’t forget to push your header file
	All your header files should be include guarded
	A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.

# Tasks
0. Bubble sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

	Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
	You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
	
	Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

	in the best case
	in the average case
	in the worst case


1. Insertion sort

Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

	Prototype: void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);
	You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
	You’re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
	
	Write in the file 1-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

	in the best case
	in the average case
	in the worst case


2. Selection sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

	Prototype: void selection_sort(int *array, size_t size);
	You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

	Write in the file 2-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

	in the best case
	in the average case
	in the worst case


3. Quick sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm

	Prototype: void quick_sort(int *array, size_t size);
	You must implement the Lomuto partition scheme.
	The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.
	You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

	Write in the file 3-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

	in the best case
	in the average case
	in the worst case
